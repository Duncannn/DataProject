    <p>Hello and welcome to my visualisation! Many first time investors hear 
       stories about people who gain large amounts of money by investing in the 
       stock market. Usually these people invest in options and not in shares. 
       But without a good view of what options really are, they can be a very 
       dangerous investment. As a result, many people who randomly invest in 
       options lose their entire investment. <br> For this visualisation you 
       will be able to invest in options and shares. Click the next button to 
       read about what shares and options really are, visit the tour to find out 
       how my visualisation works, visit the option info to find information 
       about the strategies that are available or visit the terms tab for often 
       used abbreviations.</p>

  <div id="about_2" class="box">
    <p>A share is a unit of ownership in a corporation or financial asset. Thus, 
      if you own a share of Apple, you "own" part Apple. Although you don't have 
      direct control over buisiness operations, you are entitled to an equal 
      distribution of the profits, in the form of dividend. Many people who 
      invest in shares seek to obtain profit in two possible ways:<br> 1. Price 
      differences of the shares between buying and selling them. <br> 2. Profits 
      obtained from dividends. <br> In this visualisation profit can be obtained 
      from the first way. Your profit will be shown as <b># Stocks * (ST - S0)
      </b> where <b>ST</b> is the stock price at time of selling and <b>S0</b> 
      that of buying. <br> The next section will explain options. </p>

  <div id="about_3" class="box">
    <p>As mentioned previously, options can be a dangerous investment. In this 
      visualisation I look into two different options: Call and Put options. 
      A call (put) option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to 
      enter into a contract to buy (sell) 100 shares for a predetermined price, 
      called the strike price (K), and date, called the expiration date. <br> 
      What makes this way of investing dangerous, is that if the price at 
      expiration date of a call (put) is lower (higher) than the strike price, 
      the buyer loses all his investment! Your profit will be shown as 
      <b>100 * max(ST-K,0) - price</b> for calls and 
      <b>100 * max(K-ST,0) - price</b> for puts.<br><br> Move on to the tour
      to find out how to use my visialisation.</p>

    <p>For reference, here we find the selected stock, our remaining 
       investment, the current price of the selected stock and finally a button 
       for when you want to finalize your investment. Finalising our investment 
       can be done in two ways. The first is with respect to real market 
       prices, and the second is with a simulated stock path. 
       You can only invest when you have a positive amount of money! Try them 
       both out after choosing your investments later on!</p>

  <div id="info_1" class="bubble">
    <p>Spreads are very important when investing in options. Investing in only a 
       put or call option can result in losing your entire investment. Spreads 
       are a way to both limit your losses when the market does something 
       unexpected or gives you a way to obtain payoffs which can only be obtained 
       when combining options. In the following steps all the spreads below will 
       be explained. Inspect the radio buttons after this tour to see the payoff
       function! <br> Note: Unknown terms used in the 
       comming sections can be found in "terms" box above.</p>
    <a onclick="info2()" class="nextBut">Next</a> <span><a onclick="info3()" 
       class="exitBut">X</a></span>
  </div>

  <div id="info_2" class="bubble">
    <p>The first is the bull spread. This spread is used when the investor 
       expects the stock price to rise, but still wants to limit his loss after a 
       possible decline in price. For example, assume Apple releases a brand new 
       phone. You, as an investor, expect this new phone to be very popular and 
       thus expect Apples stock price to rise. But you know there is also a small 
       probability that the phone will not get a fantastic reception, and thus 
       want to limit the loss after this occurance. <br> This spread is obtained 
       by buying one ATM call option, and writing one OTM call option.</p>
    <a onclick="info2()" class="nextBut">Next</a> <span><a onclick="info3()" 
       class="exitBut">X</a></span>
  </div>

  <div id="info_3" class="bubble">
    <p>The second is the bear spread. In general, the bear spread is used when 
       the investor expects the stock to behave in the opposite way as the bull 
       spread. Thus assuming Apple releases a new phone, you expect this phone to 
       have a very poor reception, but know there is a chance that it will be 
       popular. <br> This spread is obtained by buying one ATM call option, and 
       writing one ITM call option.</p>
    <a onclick="info2()" class="nextBut">Next</a> <span><a onclick="info3()" 
       class="exitBut">X</a></span>
  </div>

  <div id="info_4" class="bubble">
    <p>The third, the back spread, is a somewhat odd looking spread. This spread 
       is used when you know for sure that the stock price is going to change, 
       and expect it to rise, but that the chance of it dropping is larger than, 
       for example in the bull spread. As an example we can turn to Apple again. 
       The release of the iWatch was not well known, and you expect it to have a 
       great reception. But due to the fact that it is the first ever release, it 
       could also be a bust. In both scenarios you will gain profit. <br> This 
       spread is obtained by writing one ATM call option, and buying two OTM call 
       options.</p>
    <a onclick="info2()" class="nextBut">Next</a> <span><a onclick="info3()" 
       class="exitBut">X</a></span>
  </div>

  <div id="info_5" class="bubble">
    <p>The iron butterfly spread is the third spread. In this spread you expect 
       the stock price to stay put, but want to limit your losses when it does move. An 
       example would be a long period in time where both Apple and his 
       impetitors do not expect to make any ground breaking annoucements. <br> 
       This spread is obtained by writing an ATM call and put option, and buying 
       an OTM call and put option.</p>
    <a onclick="info2()" class="nextBut">Next</a> <span><a onclick="info3()" 
       class="exitBut">X</a></span>
  </div>

  <div id="info_6" class="bubble">
    <p>Finally, the last spread I consider is the strangle spread. In this 
       spread you expect expect the stock price to either rise or drop, but give 
       equal probability to both occurances. An example would be when both Apple 
       and one of its competitors releases a new item, but do not know the ins 
       and outs of either of them. <br> This spread is obtained by buying one ATM 
       call option and writing one ATM put option.</p>
